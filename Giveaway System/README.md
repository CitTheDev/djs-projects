# Giveaway
This system allows you to create and manage giveaways for your discord bot. You can enter the giveaway by pressing the button that gets generated when you select the inputs. The options for managing an existing giveaway are: `Pause`, `Unpause`, `End`, `Reroll`, `Delete`. This system will also check if any giveaway has ended while the bot was offline so that the winners can still be chosen.

## Dependencies
- Dependencies listed in the main `README.md` file
- [ms](https://github.com/vercel/ms) (`npm i ms`)

## Note
- Some folder names may need to be changed to fit your discord bot structure.
- If you do not run the file in the `Functions` folder whenever the bot is ready you will lose the feature of ending a giveaway after the bot restarts.
