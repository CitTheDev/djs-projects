# Advanced Poll System
This system allows you to seamlessly create polls with up to 25 options in them. Users can then use the select menu to provide their answer. The amount of users that have selected the option will also show on the main embed.

## Dependencies
All needed dependencies for this system are written in the `README.md` file in the root folder.

## Note
Some folder names may need to be changed to fit your discord bot structure.
