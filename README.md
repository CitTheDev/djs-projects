# Discord.js Systems
This is a repository for systems that I have made. Most systems in this repository will require you to have a MongoDB database connected via the `mongoose` package. [Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_e6E-okvxs) to show you how to connect to a MongoDB database.

## Dependencies
- discord.js (`npm i discord.js`)
- mongoose (`npm i mongoose`)

Some projects may need some packages to work. If a certain system needs a package to work it will be written in the `README.md` file in the project folder.
