# Dropdown Role Selector
This system allows you to create a role selector system. The user simply has to interact to the select menu and the bot will give or remove the role depending if they have the role or not. This system is fully customisable and can have up to 25 options.

## Dependencies
All needed dependencies for this system are written in the `README.md` file in the root folder.

## Note
A MongoDB connection is not required for this system to function.
